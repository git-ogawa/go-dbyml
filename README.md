Go-dbyml is a CLI tool to build a docker image with build options loaded from yaml. Instead of running the `docker build` with many options, write options in config file, build your docker image with them. It helps you to manage build process more readable and flexible.


Go-dbyml is a substitute of [git-ogawa/dbyml](https://github.com/git-ogawa/dbyml) with go language.


This is a pre-alpha version now.
